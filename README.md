# File Handler
Python scripts which helps you to move files from one directory to another automatically.

## When to use it?
For example, you are studying remotely and teachers send you a lot of files to do. You should download them all and move to different folders for a better understanding. You have downloaded everything and you forgot where was the math files or chemistry files. To avoid this you can use this script.

## Usage
You run the script and UI opens. You have to enter directory you are going to track and directory to where files will be transfered. Then just click Run button. You can change the *handler.py* file and enter your prefered extensions, such as .pdf, .jpg e.t.c.
